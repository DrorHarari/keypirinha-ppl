# [vcf/xxx] vCard file section
#
# Contacts are loaded from vCard files. To introduce a vCard contacts
# file, add a section with the name "vcf/{contact-file-name}" like the
# the example below. can be loaded. File names without paths assumed to be in the user
# folder. 
#
# Specifying the 'source' attribute let you copy a vCard file from a 
# shared location to the User folder. This is useful when the shared 
# location is remote not always available to load from.
#
# vCard file is a common contacts export format in many contact
# applications. It is easy, for example, to export your Google Contacts
# in a vCard format. You can use the make_contacts.py script at
# https://github.com/DrorHarari/keypirinha-ppl/blob/master/etc/make_contacts.py
# to export Outlook (Active Directory) contacts as vCard file.
#
# Specifying the 'encoding' attribute controls the character encoding
# that will be used for reading the vcf file. If not specified, the
# encoding is assumed to be UTF-8.
#
# There are some vcf card format variations. The default vcf file 
# this plugin supports assumes that the format is something like:
#
#   TEL;TYPE=CELL:+1 (617) 111-2223
#   TEL;TYPE=WORK:+1 (617) 333 4445
#   TEL;TYPE=HOME:+1 (617) 333 4445
#
# If the vcf file you use has a different format like:
#
#   TEL;CELL;VOICE:+1 (617) 111-2223
#   TEL;WORK;VOICE:+1 (617) 333 4445
#   TEL;HOME;VOICE:+1 (617) 222 6667
#
# then you can specify alternative tag when adding the vcf file as follows:
#
#  cell_tag = CELL;VOICE
#  home_tag = HOME;VOICE
#  work_tag = WORK;VOICE
#
#[vcf/company-contacts.vcf]
#source = \\fileserv\shared\company-contacts.vcf
#encoding = utf-8
#cell_tag = TYPE=CELL
#home_tag = TYPE=HOME
#work_tag = TYPE=WORK

[csv/test.csv]
#source = \\fileserv\shared\company-contacts.vcf
#flavor = google-gmail-csv
#encoding = utf-8
#cell_field = TYPE=CELL
#home_field = TYPE=HOME
#work_field = TYPE=WORK

#full_name = NAME

#last_name = Family Name
#email = E-mail 1 - Value

[main]

# Plugin's main configuration section.

# When selection the Call action, say to phone number +1-888-123-1234, Ppl
# executes the URL "tel:+1-888-123-1234" which invokes the default telephony
# application that registered the TEL: protocol. You can change this parameter
# to change the protocol. You can type "default programs" at KP to open the 
# Windows' Control Panel Default Programs screen - then click the option to 
# set your default programs, and then click the "Choose default apps by
# protocol". There you may see which program handles the TEL protocol, you can 
# set another program to handle this protocol or you can choose a different
# protocol to use for the Call action (for example, SKYPE) 
#
#call_protocol = tel:%s

# Similar to the Call action, the Cell action also uses the TEL protocol to 
# perform the call. You can change the default protocol handler for the 
# Cell action - for example, when you want to use a different method to call
# cell phones.
#
#cell_protocol = tel:%s

# The Mail action uses the MAILTO protocol. Here you can choose another 
# protocol to implement the Mail action.
#
#mail_protocol = mailto:%s

[var]
# As in every Keypirinha's configuration file, you may optionally include a
# [var] section to declare variables that you want to reuse anywhere else in
# this file.
#
# Note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value defined
# in the main configuration file (i.e. this file) will be propagated to
# subsequently loaded configuration files (packages' configuration files).
